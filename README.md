This project is a template for creating native user experience through HTML and JavaScript for MoSync cross platform SDK. For More information please refer to the Wiki page and http://www.mosync.com.
You can always start from this page.

Note: This library is experimental and might not work perfectly well in some situations.  Due to some issues you might find instability problems on Android. If so, I recommend using the latest nightly build of MoSync SDK that includes fixes for Android issues.

Feel free to contact me with feedback and questions.
